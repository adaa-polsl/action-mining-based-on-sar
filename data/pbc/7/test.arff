% Description:
% 
%      D This data is from the Mayo Clinic trial in primary biliary
%      cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver conducted between 1974 and 1984.  A
%      total of 424 PBC patients, referred to Mayo Clinic during that
%      ten-year interval, met eligibility criteria for the randomized
%      placebo controlled trial of the drug D-penicillamine.  The first
%      312 cases in the data set participated in the randomized trial and
%      contain largely complete data.  The additional 112 cases did not
%      participate in the clinical trial, but consented to have basic
%      measurements recorded and to be followed for survival.  Six of
%      those cases were lost to follow-up shortly after diagnosis, so the
%      data here are on an additional 106 cases as well as the 312
%      randomized participants.
% 
%      A nearly identical data set found in appendix D of Fleming and
%      Harrington; this version has fewer missing values.
