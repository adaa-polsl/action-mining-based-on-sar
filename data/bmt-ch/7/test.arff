%The dataset describes pediatric patients with several hematologic diseases: malignant disorders
%(i.a. patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, with acute myelogenous leukemia, with chronic myelogenous
%leukemia, with myelodysplastic syndrome) and nonmalignant cases (i.a. patients with severe aplastic anemia,
%with Fanconi anemia, with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy). 
%All patients were subject to the unmanipulated allogeneic unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
%The motivation of this study was to identify the most important factors influencing the success or failure of the transplantation procedure. 
%In particular, verification of the research hypothesis that increased dosage of CD34+ cells / kg extends overall survival
%time without simultaneous occurrence of undesirable events affecting patients' quality of life.

%- CMVstatus - Serological compatibility of the donor and the recipient of hematopoietic stem cells according to cytomegalovirus
%  infection prior to transplantation (the higher the value the lower the compatibility)
