% DESCRITPTIVE ABSTRACT:
% The data come from a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that compared the 
% three-drug regimen of indinavir (IDV), open label zidovudine (ZDV) or 
% stavudine (d4T) and lamivudine (3TC) with the two-drug regimen of 
% zidovudine or stavudine and lamivudine in HIV-infected patients (Hammer 
% et al., 1997).  Patients were eligible for the trial if they had no more 
% than 200 CD4 cells per cubic millimeter and at least three months of 
% prior zidovudine therapy.  Randomization was stratified by CD4 cell 
% count at the time of screening.  The  primary  outcome  measure  was  
% time  to  AIDS  defining event or death.  Because efficacy results met a 
% pre-specified level of significance at an interim analysis, the trial 
% was stopped early.
