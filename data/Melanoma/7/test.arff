% Description:
% 
%      In the period 1962-77, 205 patients with malignant melanoma
%      (cancer of the skin) had a radical operation performed at Odense
%      University Hospital, Denmark. All patients were followed until the
%      end of 1977 by which time 134 were still alive while 71 had died
%      (of out whom 57 had died from cancer and 14 from other causes).
% 
%      The object of the study was to assess the effect of risk factors
%      on survival. Among such risk factors were the sex and age of the
%      patients and the histological variables tumor thickness and
%      ulceration (absent vs. present).
