% DESCRIPTIVE ABSTRACT:
% The main goal of this study is to describe factors associated 
% with trends over time in the incidence and survival rates following 
% hospital admission for acute myocardial infarction (MI).  Data have been 
% collected during thirteen 1-year periods beginning in 1975 and extending 
% through 2001 on all MI patients admitted to hospitals in the Worcester, 
% Massachusetts Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area.
