% Description:
% 
%      A data frame containing the observations from the GBSG2 study.
% 
% Usage:
% 
%      data(GBSG2)
%      
% Format:
% 
%      This data frame contains the observations of 686 women:
% 
%      horTh hormonal therapy, a factor at two levels ‘no’ and ‘yes’.
% 
%      age of the patients in years.
% 
%      menostat menopausal status, a factor at two levels ‘pre’
%           (premenopausal) and ‘post’ (postmenopausal).
% 
%      tsize tumor size (in mm).
% 
%      tgrade tumor grade, a ordered factor at levels ‘I < II < III’.
% 
%      pnodes number of positive nodes.
% 
%      progrec progesterone receptor (in fmol).
% 
%      estrec estrogen receptor (in fmol).
% 
%      survival_time (previosuly time) recurrence free survival time (in days).
% 
%      survival_status (previously cens) censoring indicator (0- censored, 1- event).
